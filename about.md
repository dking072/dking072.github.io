# About

## Hi there!

I am a graduate student at the University of Minnesota pursuing a PhD in computational chemistry.

On this blog, I am posting things I would have found helpful/useful during my studiesâ€“ things I was confused about initally but have come to understand better over time. You may also get the occasional fun post about a random topic I've learned about for no reason in particular :P

I hope you find some of the things on here useful as well! If you want to get in contact with me, the best way to do so is by email at king1305@umn.edu.

Good luck with your studies!

-Daniel King
